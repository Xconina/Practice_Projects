# Practice Projects
This is a folder of practice projects that I have made from videos, tutorials, or just on my own. They are ones that show different techniques and knowledge involved but that I feel aren't large enough projects for their own repository.

## Passwordgenerator.py
```python
#prints
items in vending machine
their name, cost, id, and quantity
#input
item selection
money you have
#return
if have enough money:
    vend item
    give change
if not enough money
or if not correct item:
    error
```
## fizzbuzz.py
```python
This is a common problem. You must iterate through numbers 1-10.
#If number is divisible by 3
    print fizz.
#If divisible by 5
    print buzz.
#If divisible by both 
    print fizzbuzz.
#else 
    print number
